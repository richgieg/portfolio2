                                I thoroughly enjoyed working through the challenges
                                that this project presented. It forced me to tap the
                                many skills I've gathered in my full stack studies
                                as well as my front-end studies. I hope
                                you round up some opponents and give the game a whirl.

                            <p>
                                Before setting out to complete this project I took
                                two Udacity JavaScript courses: "Intro to AJAX" and
                                "JavaScript Design Patterns." Throughout these
                                courses I learned how to fetch data asynchonously
                                from an API server as well as how to implement
                                design patterns to ensure the maintainability of
                                front-end code. The Neighborhood Map project gave
                                me a chance to apply my new knowledge and skills
                                in order to create a single-page web application
                                featuring a Google Map containing markers for
                                New York City subway stations. The app features a
                                list of the stations that can be filtered, and
                                as they are filtered, the map's markers are updated.
                                When a map's marker is clicked, an info
                                window pops up, which displays a list of routes that
                                are associated with the station, as well as images
                                from Flickr that are geotagged within 1 km of the
                                station. After completing the two previously-mentioned
                                courses and this project, I can confidently perform
                                the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Retrieve data from an API asynchronously with AJAX</li>
                                <li>Handle errors that can occur with AJAX calls</li>
                                <li>Separate concerns by following an MVC, MVP, or MVVM pattern</li>
                                <li>Employ the Knockout.js framework for automatic DOM manipulation</li>
                                <li>Utilize object-oriented design principles and patterns</li>
                                <li>Render an app responsively to handle various screen sizes</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                By completing this project I have demonstrated my
                                ability to utilize AJAX to interact with APIs, follow
                                design patterns to create logical and maintainable front-end
                                code, as well as employ the Knockout.js framework to create
                                rich user experiences.

                                Prior to starting this project I completed two
                                Udacity full-stack web developer courses:
                                "Full Stack Foundations" and "Authentication and
                                Authorization with OAuth." I thoroughly enjoyed
                                learning how to use the Flask framework as well as
                                SQLAlchemy. Throughout these courses I learned how
                                to do the following:

                                <li>Utilize Google's OAuth2 API to implement an authentication system</li>
                                <li>Implement an authorization system</li>
                                <li>Build a RESTful web application</li>
                                <li>Implement CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods</li>

                                I had a blast completing this project. I decided to
                                implement a music shop website which allows
                                users to log in and create, edit and delete items.
                                Users log in with their Google account and must be
                                verified by an administrator (me) before they have
                                write access to the site. Once enabled, they can
                                create items and then edit or delete those items.
                                Admin accounts can edit or delete any item on the
                                site. Since I also worked through Udacity's Front-End
                                Web Developer Nanodegree program I decided to push
                                myself to implement a responsive front-end and give
                                it some polish. If you're curious, open this project on your
                                phone, tablet, laptop and desktop systems to see how
                                the layout responds. After finishing this project I now
                                have the necessary set of skills to dig deeper into
                                the Flask framework and SQLAlchemy module to create
                                more complex data-driven web applications.

                                Prior to starting this project I completed the
                                Udacity course entitled "Developing Scalable Apps
                                in Python." The focus of this project is leveraging
                                the powerful Google App Engine framework, including
                                Cloud Endpoints and Datastore, to develop
                                highly-scalable applications with APIs that are
                                accessible from a wide variety of devices.
                                After completing this course and the Conference
                                Central project, I now have the necessary skillset
                                to tackle the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use the Google App Engine SDK to build and test web apps</li>
                                <li>Push completed apps to the Google Cloud</li>
                                <li>Utilize the Google Cloud Datastore API for data storage and retrieval</li>
                                <li>Build an API server using Google Cloud Endpoints</li>
                                <li>Use the Google API Explorer for interacting with the API</li>
                                <li>Follow Datastore design best practices</li>
                                <li>Implement efficient Datastore queries</li>
                                <li>Manually create Datastore indexes required to execute the queries</li>
                                <li>Authenticate users using Google App Engine's built-in OAuth support</li>
                                <li>Create an API to the specs required by a previously-developed front-end</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Completing this project has allowed me to
                                demonstrate my thorough understanding of Google
                                App Engine as well as my solid grasp of Datastore
                                best practices. The front-end was provided by
                                Udacity, so my responsibility was the back-end
                                Python code which runs on Google App Engine and
                                exposes an API to the front-end. It was great fun
                                to utilize a data storage technology outside of the
                                SQL world that I'm so used to.

                                The primary goal of this project was to get hands-on
                                practice in architecting an object-oriented
                                JavaScript program. Since games consist of various
                                objects, it's the perfect type of application to
                                demonstrate object-oriented design principles. Also,
                                this project focused on the HTML5 canvas API. The
                                two supporting Udacity courses I completed prior to
                                starting this project are "Object-Oriented
                                JavaScript" and "HTML5 Canvas." After working through
                                these two courses and the Arcade Game project, I can
                                confidently perform the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Utilize object-oriented design principles and patterns</li>
                                <li>Harness the power of JavaScript closures</li>
                                <li>Draw graphics and text using the HTML5 Canvas API</li>
                                <li>Apply filter effects to ImageData objects</li>
                                <li>Process user input by handling browser events</li>
                                <li>Synchronize to the browser framerate with the requestAnimationFrame API</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                By completing this game project I have
                                demonstrated my ability to effectively write
                                object-oriented JavaScript software, process and
                                render graphics using the HTML5 canvas API, as well
                                as handle user input events.
